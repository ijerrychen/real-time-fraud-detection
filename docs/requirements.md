# Real-Time Fraud Detection System
## Objective:
Develop a real-time fraud detection system in Java, deploy it on a Kubernetes (K8s) cluster on a cloud platform (AWS/GCP/Ali), and ensure it is capable of detecting and handling fraudulent transactions swiftly and accurately.
## Requirements:
### 1.Core Functionality:
- Implement a service that analyzes financial transactions in real - time to detect potential fraud.
- Use a simple rule - based detection mechanism (e.g., transactions exceeding a certain amount, transactions from suspicious accounts).
- Notify (e.g., log, alert) when a fraudulent transaction is detected.
### 2.High Availability and Resilience:
- Deploy the service on a Kubernetes cluster (AWS EKS, GCP GKE, Alibaba ACK).
- Ensure the service is highly available using Kubernetes features like Deployment, Service, and Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA).
- Use message queuing services (e.g., AWS SQS, GCP Pub/Sub, Alibaba Message Service) to handle incoming transactions.
### 3.Performance:
- Ensure the service can handle real - time transaction data with low latency.
- Implement a distributed logging mechanism using cloud - native logging services (e.g., AWS CloudWatch, GCP Stackdriver, Alibaba Cloud Log Service).
### 4.Testing:
- Write unit tests using JUnit.
- Write integration tests to verify the interaction with message queuing and logging services.
- Simulate fraudulent transactions to ensure the detection mechanism works correctly.
- Perform resilience testing to ensure the service can recover from failures (e.g., pod restarts, node failures).
### 5.Documentation:
- Provide a README file with instructions on how to deploy and test the service.
- Include architecture diagrams and explanations of design choices.
### Deliverables:
- Source code repository (e.g., GitHub).
- Kubernetes deployment manifests or Helm charts.
- Test coverage report.
- Resilience test results.
- Documentation.
